Our capstone project is inspired by a game called BuriedBornes, an RPG turn based game which don't end unless you die, unless you exit the battle which prompts you whether you'll want to save or not.


We used the Builder Design Pattern for creatng an instance of Battle, because of the optional paramaeters and because you are not allowed to method overload the constructors with the same parameter data types
We also used another Builder Design Pattern for creating an instance of DisplayImages because there are lots of fields and optional parameters for the DisplayImages
