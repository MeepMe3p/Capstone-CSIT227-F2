Our capstone project is inspired by a game called BuriedBornes. Our version of BuriedBornes is an RPG turn based game that battles with enemies endlessly unless you choose to exit the game, or until your character dies.

We used the Builder Design Pattern for creatng an instance of Battle, because of the optional paramaeters and because you are not allowed to method overload the constructors with the same parameter data types
We also used another Builder Design Pattern for creating an instance of DisplayImages because there are lots of fields and optional parameters for the DisplayImages
