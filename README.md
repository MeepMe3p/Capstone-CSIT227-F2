Our capstone project is inspired by a game called BuriedBornes. Our version of BuriedBornes is an RPG turn based game that battles with enemies endlessly unless you choose to exit the game, or until your character dies.

We used the Builder Design Pattern for creating an instance of the object "Battle", since the object has optional parameters, like the boolean buttons that are used for the characters abilities.

We also used the Builder Design Pattern for creating an instance of the object "DisplayImages" since it also has a lot of optional parameters, like the textfields for the hp.
